      Hello!<br><br>
      My name is Simran Mann, and I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for C/C++ programming
      and low-level systems. I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal projects,
      and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ways to learn and grow.<br><br>
      Aside from that, I enjoy baking 
      (<a href="baking.html">check out some of my favourite recipes!</a>).

<p>
  I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for system-level programming and developing efficient and reliable software. 
  My focus areas include operating systems, concurrent and distributed programming, and embedded software, 
  but I am always eager to explore and learn more.

  I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal endeavours,
  and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ideas that push me to think differently.

  <h2>My experience : a little more about me</h2>
  <p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7;">
    My first co-op as a Software Test Engineer at Netgear was not a typical coding job; it was really hands-on, and as a result, I took away a lot more from the experience.
    There were so many networking concepts I didn’t know going into the job, and I had to figure them out by experimenting and learning as I went. I was responsible for bringing up an entire test chamber on my own, including network configurations and topologies, and had to consider the end goal: what we were trying to achieve and how to make the setup convenient for the team. I took it upon myself to streamline processes, automate routine firmware tests, and reduce a full day of work to about two hours of offline testing. I also trained other co-ops to continue the workflow, which was rewarding and taught me to be self-reliant, think critically, and develop practical, efficient solutions. In the end, it was rewarding to see how much impact small improvements could have on the team’s productivity and efficiency.

    Since May 2025, I’ve also been working with SFU Robot Soccer as a Firmware Developer. In this role, I help design and implement the basestation firmware, enabling robots to receive and parse commands through UART from the software team and relay them via LoRa to the motherboards of each robot.
    I also contribute to motherboard firmware development and testing, focusing on real-time task scheduling and reliable responses. 
    Working in this multidisciplinary team—spanning firmware, software, and electronics—has taught me a lot about integration, debugging low-level C code on bare-metal systems, and collaborating effectively with others. 
    It’s been a great way to experience how hardware, firmware, and software work together in real systems while developing teamwork and problem-solving skills in a complex project environment.
