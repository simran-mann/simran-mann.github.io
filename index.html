      Hello!<br><br>
      My name is Simran Mann, and I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for C/C++ programming
      and low-level systems. I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal projects,
      and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ways to learn and grow.<br><br>
      Aside from that, I enjoy baking 
      (<a href="baking.html">check out some of my favourite recipes!</a>).

<p>
  I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for system-level programming and developing efficient and reliable software. 
  My focus areas include operating systems, concurrent and distributed programming, and embedded software, 
  but I am always eager to explore and learn more.

  I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal endeavours,
  and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ideas that push me to think differently.

  <h2>My experience : a little more about me</h2>
  <p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7;">
    My first co-op as a Software Test Engineer at Netgear was not a typical coding job; it was really hands-on, and as a result, I took away a lot more from the experience.
    There were so many networking concepts I didn’t know going into the job, and I had to figure them out by experimenting and learning as I went. I was assigned tasks like bringing up an entire test chamber on my own,
    including all the network configurations and topologies. I also had to think about the end goal: what we were trying to achieve and how to make the setup easy and convenient for everyone working in the lab.
    This experience taught me to be self-reliant, think critically about systems, and develop practical, efficient solutions - skills that have helped me with every other project since.
    <br><br>
    At the same time, I also ran routine tests on new firmware releases on the devices, and there was a lot of work to do, so as a result a lot of things were delayed. The repetitive tasks were not getting done on time because 
    the more hands-on tasks were higher priority. I noticed that there were ways to make the repetitive testing process more efficient, so I took it upon myself to improve it. 
    The main test that we had to run took about a full work day to run, and I was able to automate the entire process and reduce it down to around 2 hours of offline testing, so you can just start running the test and focus on doing more productive things.
    Once it was running smoothly, I trained other co-ops so they could continue the workflow. In the end, it was really rewarding to see how much impact small improvements could have on the way the team worked.

    Since May 2025, I’ve also been working with SFU Robot Soccer as a Firmware Developer. In this role, I help design and implement the basestation firmware, enabling robots to receive and parse commands through UART from the software team and relay them via LoRa to the motherboards of each robot.
    I also contribute to motherboard firmware development and testing, focusing on real-time task scheduling and reliable responses. 
    Working in this multidisciplinary team—spanning firmware, software, and electronics—has taught me a lot about integration, debugging low-level C code on bare-metal systems, and collaborating effectively with others. 
    It’s been a great way to experience how hardware, firmware, and software work together in real systems while developing teamwork and problem-solving skills in a complex project environment.
