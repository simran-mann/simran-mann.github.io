      Hello!<br><br>
      My name is Simran Mann, and I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for C/C++ programming
      and low-level systems. I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal projects,
      and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ways to learn and grow.<br><br>
      Aside from that, I enjoy baking 
      (<a href="baking.html">check out some of my favourite recipes!</a>).

<p>
  I am a fourth-year computing science student at SFU with a passion for system-level programming and developing efficient and reliable software. 
  My focus areas include operating systems, concurrent and distributed programming, and embedded software, 
  but I am always eager to explore and learn more.
  <br><br>
  I enjoy tackling challenging problems both in my studies and personal endeavours,
  and I love solving puzzles and exploring new ideas that push me to think differently.

  <h2>My experience: a little more about me</h2>
  <p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7;">
    My first co-op as a Software Test Engineer at Netgear was not a typical coding job; it was really hands-on, and as a result, I took away a lot more from the experience. I was responsible for bringing up an entire test chamber on my own, including network configurations and topologies, and had to consider the end goal: what we were trying to achieve and how to make the setup convenient for the team.
  </p>
  <p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7;">
    I took it upon myself to streamline processes, automate routine firmware tests, and reduce a full day of work to about two hours of offline testing. I also trained other co-ops to continue the workflow, which was rewarding and taught me to be self-reliant, think critically, and develop practical, efficient solutions. In the end, it was rewarding to see how much impact small improvements could have on the team’s productivity and efficiency.

<p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 24px;">
At SFU Robot Soccer, I work on the development, testing, and debugging of firmware for the robot motherboards and basestation,
ensuring the robots receive commands from the AI agent developed by the software team and respond in real time.
I designed and implemented the basestation firmware to receive and parse packets from the software team and relay them over RF to the robots,
 which then schedule tasks and execute commands accordingly. Working in this team spanning firmware, software, and electronics
 has taught me a lot about bare metal C programming, integration, and effective collaboration and team-work.

  <h2>My Goal</h2>
  <p style="color: #555555; line-height: 1.7;">
    Having worked on both the hands-on testing side and the development side of low-level systems, my goal is to contribute to these systems on a production-level team and collaborate with highly motivated individuals. 
    I am currently looking for summer 2026 internships - if you would like to discuss any potential projects or roles, please reach out to me! :)
